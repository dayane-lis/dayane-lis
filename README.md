- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project where I can learn more about front-end. :raising_hand:
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with programming Javascript, Python, etc...
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. If I know the answer, I'll tell you. :laughing:
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: I'm an apprentice. 
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her. :woman:
